# Expense Tracking Web Application

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Expense Tracking Web Application project! In this project, I have developed a user-friendly web application that allows users to efficiently manage and track their expenses. By combining the power of Excel, Python, and MySQL, this application enables users to input, categorize, and search their expenses effortlessly.

## Key Features
- **Expense Entry:** Enter expenses with details like date, category, amount, and description.
- **Search:** Easily find expenses using keywords by specific categories.
- **Collaborative Effort:** Developed using Excel, Python, and MySQL technologies.

## Project Structure
- **app.py:** The main Flask application file for routing and rendering templates.
- **templates/:** Contains HTML templates for various pages, such as the home page and about page.
- **expenses.xlsx:** Sample Excel file with fictional expense data.
- **expenses_start.py:** Script to populate the MySQL database with data from `expenses.xlsx`.
- **requirements.txt:** List of required packages to run the application.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `expenses_start.py` to populate the MySQL database with sample expense data.
4. Run `app.py` to start the Flask application.
5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the Expense Tracking Web Application.

## Next Steps
Enhance User Experience: Add user authentication to allow multiple users to track their expenses securely.
Data Analytics: Incorporate data visualization tools to provide insights into spending patterns and trends.
Mobile Compatibility: Optimize the application for mobile devices to allow users to track expenses on the go.
Budgeting Tools: Integrate budgeting features to help users set and monitor their financial goals.
Cloud Integration: Store data in the cloud for seamless access across different devices.
